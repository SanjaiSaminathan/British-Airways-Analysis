# British-Airways-Analysis

British Airways Customer Booking Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting customer booking completion for British Airways. The code utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to analyze customer data and determine the likelihood of completing a booking.

Files
britishairways2.ipynb: Contains the Python code for the analysis. This notebook includes:

Data Loading and Preparation: Loading the customer booking dataset, handling categorical variables, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the training data and evaluating its performance on the validation and test sets.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most important features influencing booking completion.
Visualization: Displaying the top 10 most important features through a bar chart.
output_dataset.csv: The preprocessed customer booking dataset.

Dependencies
pandas
scikit-learn (sklearn)
matplotlib
Instructions
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib.
Prepare Data: Ensure the output_dataset.csv file is in the same directory as the code.
Run the Code: Execute the britishairways2.ipynb notebook.
Results
The code will display the following results:

Validation Accuracy
Test Accuracy
Classification Reports (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Support) for both validation and test sets
Top 10 important features with their respective importance scores
A bar chart visualizing the top 10 important features
Next Steps
Improve Model Performance: Explore different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
Deploy Model: Integrate the trained model into a real-time system for predicting customer booking completion.
Further Analysis: Conduct further analysis to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and identify areas for improvement in booking processes.
This project provides a starting point for predicting customer booking completion for British Airways. By utilizing machine learning techniques and analyzing relevant data, the airline can improve its understanding of customer behavior, optimize marketing efforts, and ultimately increase booking rates.
